# Material-Design-ML-Model
A hybrid machine learning-simulation model for predicting material strength.

## Overview
- Developed a neural network with residual correction to predict mechanical strength.
- Achieved MAE of 8.99 MPa and correlation of 0.997.
- Uses Python, PyTorch, and sklearn.

## Usage
Run `material_design_model_v48.py` to train and predict.

## Files
- `material_design_model_v48.py`: Main script.
- `material_model.pth`: Saved neural network weights.
- `residual_correction_model.pkl`: Saved correction model.
